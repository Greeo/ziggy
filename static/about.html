                <p>This project began as a personal way of processing David Bowie's passing, and bsking in his songs, but it turned into an experiment that a few others liked exploring too.</p>
                <p><strong>Above all, it is an examination of persona.</strong> David Bowie continually changed, gifting us many new characters and incredible songs, during a beloved career.</p>
                <p> <strong>The objective of the app is to see if there is a correlation between his written lyrics and his visual personas.</strong></p>
                <p>We take the lyrics from albums that correspond to each persona/period and run personality insights on them. Clicking on one of the drawings of Bowie on the main view opens a page that links like Twitter for that persona. </p>
                <p>The 'tweets' contain sankey diagrams that break down the big five personality traits and a little bar chart that shows the combined trait measurements.</p>
                <p>Displaying this as a Twitter page emphasizes the theme of persona. This app is also trying to honor the personas in a fun way, through mining the data within them, it is trying share an understanding of the personas, and songs over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="panelb" class="panel">
                <p>From the main view you can also find a link to a page which shows the big five traits over time, and per persona.</p>
                <p>A few things stood out to me in this data. For instance, in 1975 - the thin white duke period - Bowie himself suggested this was his darkest most unlike able persona - you can see the openness trait dips significantly.</p>
                <p>Curiously for the same period this was when his lyrics were most agreeable.</p>
                <p> His lyrics were not agreeable across the personas at all - Bowie really challenged authority - maybe why he appealed so much. There are also controls to toggle between the contributing sub-traits.</p>
                <p> This view shows how we can track personality over time.</p>
                <p>Finally there is a view to find your inner Bowie. Reading your tweets and mapping to the closest markers of one of the personas. We show this comparison in overlapping polar charts. We use a range of visualization to examine the personalities from different angles.</p>
                <p>This site was hand crafted with css/html - no jquery, no bootstrap ... Just plain css flex layouts ...</p>
                <p> The main Bowie images were all drawn in illustrator based on the same 'nude' Bowie model</p>
                <p> Used Pantone colors of spring 2016 as a palette</p>
                <p>Wanted a consistent, colorful, fun but respectful way to navigate his personalities over time.</p>
