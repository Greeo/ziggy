From 'Space Oddity' to 'Blackstar', David Bowie inspired us with his diverse personas. What can IBM Watson reveal about those iconic personalities through natural language analysis?

In this session, we'll see how Ziggy works, discuss use cases for the technology, compare outputs, and think about future iterations.
