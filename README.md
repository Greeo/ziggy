Little Wonder: Exploring David Bowie's lyrics with Python, Watson & Bluemix
 
From 'Space Oddity' to 'Blackstar', David Bowie inspired us with his diverse personas. What can IBM Watson reveal about those iconic personalities through natural language analysis? That's the mission of 'Ziggy' a little Python app that builds a database of songs, and digs into the style and tone of writing within them. In this session, we'll see how Ziggy works, discuss use cases for the technology, compare outputs, and think about future iterations.
